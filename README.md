# Focus

A new tab experience that's simple and useful! It's just a simple notepad to hold your notes :)

## TODO

- Why do I have a config.json file?
- Change the `b` bolded markdown text to gold color and underline `a` links in `app.css`
- Go through the `lib/googlefonts.css` file and remove all fonts that I don't use
- Create a better icon LOL
- Store files in the firefox sync storage instead of my own API
- Change the `options.html` to hold new options
