# Focus

> UPDATE: The project is archived in favor of a better version. This version was only used by myself and couldn't be used by others.
> The code for the backend is in my [old API code](https://github.com/MichaelZhao21/api/blob/dc130da5d52c0b1fd6ff5297560bb7572b0e9f91/routes/todo.js).
> This version features a working clock/date display, pictures automatically pulled from Unsplash, and a server-synced (single-page) notepad.

A new tab experience that's simple and useful! It's just a simple notepad to hold your notes :)

## TODO

- Go through the `lib/googlefonts.css` file and remove all fonts that I don't use
